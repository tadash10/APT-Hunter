    In your main script where you want to integrate with threat intelligence feeds, add the following line at the beginning of your script to import the CLI instructions:

bash

source /path/to/threat_intel_cli.sh

    Now you can call the CLI instructions by simply calling the function threat_intel_cli.sh within your main script. For example:

graphql

#!/usr/bin/env python

# Import the CLI instructions for integrating with threat intelligence feeds
source /path/to/threat_intel_cli.sh

# Call the CLI function
threat_intel_cli.sh

# Rest of your main script
# ...

With this approach, you can keep your main script clean and organized, and easily import and use the CLI instructions for integrating with threat intelligence feeds as needed.
